# Greeter-JS-Library
A very small java script library that helps us to show greeting in an web page.


# I made Greetr some requirements in mind

1. When given firstname, lastname, optional language it generates formal and informal greeting

2. It should support english and spanish language (for starter).

3. It should be reusable, it will not affect any other javascript code.

4. For easy typing use 'G$()' structure.

5. It should support jQuery.

6. It should have some chainable methods.


# Some examples are showed in app.js file

# This library use the code pattern of jQuery source code
